# Tentas Ranker

A simple Windows program that reorders your list based on a decision between left or right.
# How to use
This section tells you how to use the program.

## Text File
- Create a .txt file on your pc with the list to reorder. Every option should be in it's own custom line.
- Select your file on startup and check on the right, if every option showed up correctly.


## Rounds
- Select a number of rounds between 2 and 100.
Every round you add increases the accuracy of the Ranker.
If the number is less than 2, it is increased to 2, and if the number is greater than 100, it is decreased to 100. Every provided text that is not a number will be set to 2.
